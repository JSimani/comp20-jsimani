    <h1>COMP20 Assignment 4: Security</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The product in question is a server that stores scores for the popular game, 2048. The server has three routes: a GET route (/) that displays all of the names, scores and dates for 2048 games submitted to the server, a GET route (/scores.json) that returns a list of scores for a specific user when specified in the query, and a POST route that submits an entry for a new score to be added to the server. I was hired to find possible vulnerabilities in this server, which could be used to exploit it for malicious reasons. 
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        I used various queries to the server, through all three possible routes, to find various vulnerabilities in its structure and exploit them to show the server's weaknesses. 
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

    <h2>Issues Found</h2>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        After extensive hacking and attempted breaches into the 2048 game server, I have concluded that it has underlying vulnerabilities that could easily compromise its integrity when used by the wrong people.
