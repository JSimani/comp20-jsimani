## 1. Purpose of This Git Repository
The purpose of this Git repository was so that graders for Web Programming could easily access my submissions for assignments and labs, and track my progress as I completed them.

## 2. Favorite Lab/Assignment
My favorite assignment was the MBTA Assignment because I was able to get hands-on experience using APIs with XML Http Requests, as well as making an aesthetically pleasing website.

## 3. Most Important Concept Learned
The use of external servers to gather/present information to the user of your product. It usually shouldn't be your responsibility to store all of the information needed by a website, so API calls are especially useful for retreiving useful information in real time from an outside source.
* MBTA schedules regularly change, and it is not our website's responsibility to keep track of those changes when another website already does that for you. Using an external API call to the MBTA's API solves this problem for us so that our displayed schedule dynamically updates as the MBTA updates it on their end.
* The 2048 game should not have to keep track of all of the scores locally on one machine. By outsourcing it to an external server, multiple users of the game can interact with the high scores and see other users' high scores by making a request to the game server. 

## 4. Further Exploration Interests
Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve deeper into the ideas behind large servers and how they work. We've been working with NodeJS, PythonSimpleHTTPServer, and Heroku, but none are really equipped to handle a large amount of traffic at any given time. I would like to learn more about how a system of servers can interact with each other to handle a large amount of traffic to still serve the same content to every user.
